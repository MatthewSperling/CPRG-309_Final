            <span>Jarad Anthony Higgins, known professionally as Juice Wrld, was an American rapper and singer-songwriter. He emerged as a leading figure in the emo and SoundCloud rap genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s. His stage name, which he said represents "taking over the world", was derived from the crime thriller film Juice.
                Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 under the name JuicetheKidd and signed a recording contract with Grade A Productions and Interscope Records in 2017. He gained recognition with the diamond-certified single "Lucid Dreams", which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was included on his triple platinum debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance, alongside the singles "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100. He then released a collaborative mixtape with Future, Wrld on Drugs, and released his second album, Death Race for Love, in 2019; it contained the hit single "Robbery" and became Higgins' first number one debut on the US Billboard 200.
                Higgins died of a drug overdose on December 8, 2019.
